    "**Label Encoding**: The LabelEncoder from sklearn is used to transform the categorical labels in the \"category\" column into numerical labels that can be used by machine learning algorithms. The transformed labels are stored in a new column 'label'.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Word2Vec Model Training**: A Word2Vec model is trained on the training set. This model generates a 100-dimensional vector for each word, considering a window of 5 words at a time. A word must appear at least twice in the corpus to be included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vectorization**: For each sentence in the training and test sets, the Word2Vec vectors of the words in the sentence are averaged to create a single vector representation of the sentence. This is done only for words that are present in the Word2Vec model's vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling Empty Vectors**: If a sentence doesn't contain any words present in the Word2Vec model's vocabulary, it results in an empty vector. To handle this, if a vector is empty, it's replaced with a zero vector of the same dimensionality as the Word2Vec vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensuring Matching Lengths**: It checks to ensure the length of the features (X_train_vect) matches the length of the target variable (y_train). If they don't match, it trims the longer one to match the length of the shorter one.\n"
